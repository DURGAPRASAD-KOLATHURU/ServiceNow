        <h2>About:</h2><br>
        A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after <em>leading India to glory</em> in the <strong>Under-19 World Cup</strong> at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.

        <h3 id="test">About Test Match</h3>
        <p>Test matches are the international form of First-class fixtures. They are widely seen as the highest standard of cricket, with Test statistics being the benchmark of greatness. In the past, Test matches could have been timeless or six-day games with rest days in between.</p><hr>
        <h3 id="odi">About Odi Match</h3>
        <p>ODIs are international List A games. Teams that have ODI status, or play in official tournaments sanctioned by the ICC, play ODIs. Therefore, not all international cricket played between Associate Nations of the ICC can be considered ODIs. Some of them may be List A fixtures. When ODIs were first played in the early 1970s, 60 overs per side constituted a match. That later changed to 50 overs per innings and remains that way to this day.</p><hr>
        <h3 id="t20">Abot T20 Match</h3>
        <p>The newest and shortest form of the game, T20s—as the name suggests— require a maximum of 20 overs per innings. The minimum number of overs for T20s is five per inning, where rain or other interruptions occur. Like List A games, T20s have fielding and bowling restrictions. The duration of T20 matches is approximately three hours.</p>
